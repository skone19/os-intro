Betty:' My family is a rather small one, with only three people, my father, my mother and me. My father is a doctor.
 My mother is a middle-school teacher. I am still a student.
 My mother is very gentle and soft while my father is a little bit hot-tempered. We love each other very much.
 lthough sometimes we might become angry at one another, very soon we will forget the unpleasant things. 
We're a happy family, how about you?'
